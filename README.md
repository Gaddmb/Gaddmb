 Hi, I’m Gaddiel or Koumo if you prefer! Anyway, to keep it short: I’m a junior web developer, freshly graduated from OpenClassrooms.
 I code, I debug… and sometimes I talk to my screen or my lines of code as if they were villains (don’t judge me).).<br />

 Here, I’m showing you all my skills… as if I were baring it all in front of you. Well, maybe not completely, but you get the idea.
 And if you’re curious and brave, stick around… but be warned: put on your sunglasses, because you’re about to see lines of code that could almost blind you.
 If you want to continue this adventure, it’s at your own risk

 My Skills :<br />
 Front-end development → Turning mockups into smooth and interactive interfaces.<br />
 Debugging → Spotting and fixing errors before they mess with the user experience.<br />
 Dynamic animations → Creating impactful animations that bring websites to life.<br />
 API integration → Connecting the right resources for fast and efficient applications.<br />

 Why me ?<br />
 Always motivated and ready for new challenges…<br />
 Skilled at bug fixing.<br />
 Passionate about design and UX, I aim to deliver solid user experiences. <br />
